      Iceland is a country of extreme geological contrasts. Widely known as
      “The Land of Fire and Ice” Iceland is home to some of the largest
      glaciers in Europe, and some of the world’s most active volcanoes.
      Iceland is also the land of light and darkness. Long summer days with
      near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a
      few hours of daylight.

    <h3>Iceland is not a destination, It is an adventure.</h3>

    <p>
      Iceland remains largely uninhabited, with more than half of its 320.000
      inhabitants living in the capital city. In fact, a mere twenty minute
      drive from Reykjavik center takes you out of the hubbub of city life and
      into the seclution of Iceland's spectacular landscapes, which
      inspireadventures from its shores to its mountain tops. But the
      landscape is not just for gaping at; Iceland's rivers are perfect for
      rafting, fishing, diving and snorkeling; its mountains, volcanoes and
      glaciers are good for hiking, climbing, dog-sledding, and snowmobiling;
      its snowy hills for skiing and snowboarding; its waves for surfing; its
      caves for exploring; and its barren highlands for jeep safaris.

      “There is no more sagacious animal than the Icelandic horse. He is
      stopped by neither snow, nor storm, nor impassable roads, nor rocks,
      glaciers, or anything. He is courageous, sober, and surefooted. He never
      makes a false step, never shies. If there is a river or fjord to cross
      (and we shall meet with many) you will see him plunge in at once, just
      as if he were amphibious, and gain the opposite bank.”

    <h3>The Land of Giants</h3>
    <p>
      With almost 80% of the country uninhabited, much of Iceland's terrain
      consists of plateaux, mountain peaks, and fertile lowlands. There are
      many long, deep fjords and glaciers, including Europe's largest,
      Vatnajökull. The landscape is characterized by waterfalls, geysers,
      volcanoes, black sand beaches, and otherworldly steaming lava fields.
      Fjaðrárgljúfur is a magnificent and massive canyon, about 100 meters
      deep and about two kilometres long. The canyon has sheer walls, and is
      somewhat serpentine and narrow. The bedrock in Fjaðrárgljúfur is mostly
      palagonite from cold periods of the Ice Age and is thought to be about
      two million years old.

    <p>
      The aurora borealis takes its name from the roman goddess of dawn,
      aurora, and the greek name for the north wind, boreas. From September to
      April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show.

      Iceland is home to the largest glaciers in Europe, as well as some of
      the world's most active volcanoes. It is widely known as "The Land of
      Fire and Ice". But Iceland escapes definition. It is also the land of
      light and darkness. Its location, just below the Arctic Circle, makes
      for long summer days with near 24-hours of sunlight; offset by short
      winter days with very little sunlight at all. Fortunately, while winters
      in Iceland are dark, they are relatively mild and play host to one of
      nature's most spectacular exhibitions of beauty; the Aurora Borealis.
